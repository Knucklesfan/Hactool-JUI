# Hactool-JUI
Java based GUI for Hactool

# Usage

Well, right now the program actually... Doesn't work. I haven't had much time to work on this, but all the stuff is there, so if anyone wants to contribute to the project, please do! I don't have any time to work on it but if I did I most certainly would iron out the bugs.

# Update
I never finished this lol. Hactool isnt very popular anymore, (but it's still very used!) but back then hactool was extremely useful even to the common homebrew user. This is old as dirt, please ignore.
